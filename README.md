# Concatenate
MoviePy - simple MP4 concatenator

How to use:


From the working directory of concatenate.py, make two folders:

1. 'sample_mp4s' - this will contain a set list of mp4s the user can chose from
2. 'final_folder' - this will contain the final concatenated profuct saved under a name specified by the user
3. Load the 'sample_mp4s' folder with mp4s
4. concatenate.py is ready to run

Possible changes:

Lines 10-13 can be edited to change the directory from which the user can select files from

Lines 20-23 should be edited if you don't use the name 'sample-mp4s'

Line 32 should be edited to match your desired name of the 'final_folder' directory
